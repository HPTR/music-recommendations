# music-recommendations

This is a single page application created as an outlet for me to share new music discoveries I make. I rarely know who to suggest songs to, so I end up not sharing my discoveries at all, this application will act as a place for me to store my finds, and for those who are interested to see them.

## More Info

I wanted to develop my skills using React, so I opted to use it to create this application. It has also been useful to practice using Sass, in tandem with the BEM naming convention, to create a page that's pleasing to the eye, whilst maintaining readibility of the style rules.
